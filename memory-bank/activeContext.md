# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Focus: Email Reminder System Integration

The application has been enhanced with a comprehensive email reminder system that automatically notifies users about upcoming tasks. This implementation provides proactive task management by sending reminder emails 30 minutes before a task's due time, ensuring users don't miss important deadlines.

### Email Reminder System Features

1. **Automatic Scheduling**
   - Tasks with both due date and time automatically schedule reminders
   - Reminders are set to trigger 30 minutes before the task's due time
   - Only future reminders are scheduled (past due dates are skipped)
   - System verifies a reminder hasn't already been sent for the task

2. **Reminder Management**
   - Cancellation when tasks are:
     - Completed
     - Deleted
     - Updated with new due dates/times
   - Rescheduling when tasks are:
     - Marked as incomplete (after being completed) 
     - Updated with new due dates/times

3. **Persistence Across Sessions**
   - Sent reminder tracking persists in localStorage
   - All active reminders are rescheduled on page load
   - TimeoutIDs are tracked for proper cancellation

4. **Professional Email Formatting**
   - Task title prominently displayed
   - Due date and time clearly formatted
   - Priority level indicated
   - Notes or description included
   - Emails sent via EmailJS service

5. **Integration with Task Lifecycle**
   - Email reminders are fully integrated with all task operations
   - Adding, deleting, updating, and completing tasks all properly handle reminders
   - Proper cleanup of cancelled reminders to prevent memory leaks

This system enhances the application by making it more proactive in helping users stay on top of their tasks without requiring them to constantly check the application.

## Previous Focus: Date/Time Standardization & User-Controlled Selection

The application was previously enhanced with a user-controlled date/time selection system that ensures accurate due date and time assignment for tasks. This implementation addresses persistent issues with AI-based date parsing and timezone inconsistencies by giving users direct control over date and time selection through a confirmation modal.

### Date Display Standardization

To improve date/time consistency throughout the application, we've implemented a standardization approach that treats the user-selected date/time as the single source of truth:

- Modified the `formatDate()` function to avoid timezone-related date shifts
- Updated the `groupTasksByDate()` function to maintain consistent date handling
- Enhanced the `isSameDay()` function with component-based comparison instead of direct Date object comparison
- Added clear documentation throughout the date handling code

This standardization ensures that wherever a task's due date is displayed—in the task card, summary, or filter—it shows exactly the date that was selected in the confirmation modal or edit screen, without any reinterpretation or timezone-based shifts.

### Current Code Status

- Added a new date/time confirmation modal to the UI with HTML and CSS
- Implemented several JavaScript functions for modal functionality:
  - `populateTimeOptions()` to create time dropdown options in 15-minute increments
  - `showDateTimeModal()` to display the modal with pre-selected options based on AI parsing
  - `setupDateOptionListeners()` to handle quick-select button interactions
  - `confirmTaskWithSelectedDate()` to process the user-selected date/time
  - `cancelTaskCreation()` to handle cancellation
- Modified task creation flow to show the confirmation modal after AI parsing
- Created state variables to track original task text and parsed task during the confirmation process
- Made the date/time selection process intuitive with quick-select options and visual feedback
- Created appropriate backup before implementing the standardization

### Date Selection Enhancement Features

The system now provides a reliable, user-controlled approach to date and time selection:

1. **Quick-Select Date Options**
   - Today
   - Tomorrow 
   - Next Week
   - No Due Date
   - All implemented with consistent date handling to prevent timezone shifts

2. **Calendar-Style Date Picker**
   - Native HTML date input with browser-standard calendar picker
   - Supports selecting any specific date
   - Pre-populated with the AI's suggested date when available
   - Dates treated as source of truth throughout the application

3. **Time Selection Dropdown**
   - 15-minute increments throughout the 24-hour day
   - Displayed in 12-hour format with AM/PM for user friendliness
   - Defaults to 9:00 AM if no specific time was detected

4. **Multi-Step Flow with Standardized Date Handling**
   - AI still parses the natural language input for task details (title, priority, category)
   - Modal appears after parsing is complete with suggested date/time
   - User can review and modify or confirm the date/time
   - Task is created with exactly the date/time selected by the user
   - All date displays consistently show the user-selected date without reinterpretation

This approach completely resolves date-related issues in the application by:
1. Giving users direct control through the confirmation modal
2. Treating the selected date as the definitive source of truth
3. Using consistent date handling methods throughout the codebase
4. Eliminating timezone-related date shifts in the UI

## Recent Changes

- Updated date display standardization to preserve user-selected dates:
  - Modified `formatDate()` function to avoid timezone shifts
  - Enhanced `groupTasksByDate()` to use component-based date comparison
  - Improved `isSameDay()` function to compare date components directly
  - Added clear documentation throughout the date handling code
  - Created a backup of app.js before implementing these changes
- Previously added date/time confirmation modal for user control:
  - Added modal to HTML structure with intuitive UI
  - Created matching CSS styling for the modal
  - Implemented time dropdown with 15-minute increments
  - Added quick-select buttons for common date options
  - Modified task creation to include the confirmation step

## Next Steps

1. Consider additional date selection enhancements:
   - Add recurring task options to the date selection modal
   - Support for selecting date ranges
   - Custom presets for common recurring patterns (weekly, monthly)

2. Improve the time selection interface:
   - Consider a more visual time picker
   - Add commonly used time presets (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
   - Support for duration in addition to specific times

3. Further enhance the task creation workflow:
   - Add confirmation for other task attributes (priority, category)
   - Preview the fully parsed task before creation
   - Add task templates for common task types
