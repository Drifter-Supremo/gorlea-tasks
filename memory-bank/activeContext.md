### Previous Focus: Email Reminder System Integration

The application has been enhanced with a comprehensive email reminder system that automatically notifies users about upcoming tasks. This implementation provides proactive task management by sending reminder emails 30 minutes before a task's due time, ensuring users don't miss important deadlines.

#### Email Reminder System Features

1. **Automatic Scheduling**
   - Tasks with both due date and time automatically schedule reminders
   - Reminders are set to trigger 30 minutes before the task's due time
   - Only future reminders are scheduled (past due dates are skipped)
   - System verifies a reminder hasn't already been sent for the task

2. **Reminder Management**
   - Cancellation when tasks are:
     - Completed
     - Deleted
     - Updated with new due dates/times
   - Rescheduling when tasks are:
     - Marked as incomplete (after being completed) 
     - Updated with new due dates/times

3. **Persistence Across Sessions**
   - Sent reminder tracking persists in localStorage
   - All active reminders are rescheduled on page load
   - TimeoutIDs are tracked for proper cancellation

4. **Professional Email Formatting**
   - Task title prominently displayed
   - Due date and time clearly formatted
   - Priority level indicated
   - Notes or description included
   - Emails sent via EmailJS service

5. **Integration with Task Lifecycle**
   - Email reminders are fully integrated with all task operations
   - Adding, deleting, updating, and completing tasks all properly handle reminders
   - Proper cleanup of cancelled reminders to prevent memory leaks
