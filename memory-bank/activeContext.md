# Active Context: Gorlea Tasks

## Current Focus: Deployment Optimization

With the UI/UX overhaul now complete, the project focus has shifted to optimizing for deployment and ease of use. This includes streamlining the user setup process and preparing the app for public hosting.

### Completed UI/UX Overhaul

The UI/UX redesign has been successfully implemented with the following improvements:

1. **Improved Layout and Organization**
   - ✓ Centered layout with consistent spacing and alignment
   - ✓ Clean, modern, minimal interface with clear visual hierarchy
   - ✓ Implemented scrollable task container with custom scrollbar styling
   - ✓ Designed dedicated Gorlea chatbox in the style of modern AI assistants

2. **Enhanced Task Filtering**
   - ✓ Implemented comprehensive filter dropdown for tasks
   - ✓ Categories include: All, Active, Completed, High/Medium/Low Priority
   - ✓ Completed tasks now hidden by default (must use filter to show)

3. **Mobile Compatibility Improvements**
   - ✓ Ensured consistent functionality across device sizes
   - ✓ Optimized touch interactions with appropriately sized buttons
   - ✓ Responsive design addresses small screen issues

## Current Focus: GitHub Pages Preparation

The application is being prepared for GitHub Pages deployment with the following considerations:

1. **API Key Security**
   - Removed hardcoded Firebase configuration from the main codebase
   - Simplified user setup to only require OpenAI API key
   - Secured all sensitive credentials properly

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
   - Provided clear deployment guidance
   - Documented security considerations for API keys

## Critical Considerations

### Security Balance
The app now strikes a balance between security and ease of use:
- Firebase configuration is included (as Firebase API keys are designed to be public)
- OpenAI API keys are stored only in localStorage and never exposed
- All credentials are handled with appropriate security measures

### User Experience
The setup process has been simplified:
- First-time users only need to provide their OpenAI API key
- Existing Firebase infrastructure is reused
- Clear instructions guide users through the minimal setup

### Technical Constraints
The app continues to work within these constraints:
- Maintains vanilla JavaScript implementation (no framework adoption)
- Preserves PWA capabilities including offline functionality
- Ensures Firebase integration works seamlessly
- Keeps performance optimal on both desktop and mobile

## Recent Changes

- Completed centralized layout with improved styling
- Implemented scrollable task container with custom scrollbar
- Redesigned filter system using a dropdown
- Created dedicated chat interface with improved styling
- Simplified the setup process by focusing only on OpenAI API key
- Updated documentation for GitHub Pages deployment
- Ensured completed tasks hide by default through the filter system

## Next Steps

1. Update the remaining Memory Bank files to reflect current project state
2. Consider implementing user authentication for enhanced security
3. Explore additional PWA features for better offline experience
4. Investigate performance optimizations for mobile devices
5. Evaluate potential AI enhancements for task suggestions
6. Consider implementing data export/import functionality
