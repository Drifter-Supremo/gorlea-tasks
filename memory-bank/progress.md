## Known Issues

### UI/UX Issues
1. Task list becomes unwieldy with many tasks (needs scroll container)
2. Mobile layout has spacing and alignment issues on some devices
3. Filter buttons can overflow on small screens

### Functionality Issues
1. Occasional Firebase synchronization delays
2. âœ… AI parsing misinterpreting complex date/time expressions - fixed with user confirmation modal
3. Offline mode has limited AI capabilities
4. Task editing form lacks client-side validation
5. âœ… Date parsing issue for formats like "Thursday March 13th" - fixed and implemented
6. âœ… Timezone handling issue causing inconsistent date display - fixed

### Performance Issues
1. Initial load time can be slow on slower connections
2. Large task lists can cause performance issues on mobile devices
3. Firebase cold start latency affects API response times

## Recently Completed Features

### Date/Time Confirmation Modal
- âœ… Implemented a user-controlled date/time selection system with confirmation modal
- âœ… Added quick-select buttons for common date options (Today, Tomorrow, Next Week, No Due Date)
- âœ… Created calendar date picker for specific date selection
- âœ… Added time dropdown with 15-minute increments throughout the day
- âœ… Modified task creation workflow to include confirmation step
- âœ… Added state tracking for original task text and parsed task during confirmation
- âœ… Maintained compatibility with existing AI parsing for other task attributes
- âœ… Ensured the modal works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- âœ… Created consistent visual styling to match the application's aesthetic
- âœ… Added clear error handling and cancellation support

### Date Timezone Handling Fix
- âœ… Fixed date timezone handling in the `isSameDay` function for consistent comparison 
- âœ… Enhanced the `groupTasksByDate` function to ensure consistent timezone handling
- âœ… Added a `getDaySuffix` helper function for proper ordinal date formatting (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
- âœ… Improved task description generation to show consistently formatted dates
- âœ… Created backup of the fixed implementation (app.js.fixed-date-parsing)
- âœ… Resolved the issue of inconsistent date display across different parts of the application

### AI Date Context Enhancement
- âœ… Implemented rich date context generation for AI task parsing
- âœ… Enhanced system prompts to provide AI with complete calendar information
- âœ… Added improved date validation logic to detect and handle edge cases
- âœ… Fixed issue with tasks incorrectly being marked as overdue
- âœ… Created comprehensive backup (app.js.enhanced-date-context)

### Code Recovery
- âœ… Restored app.js from VS Code conflict state
- âœ… Fixed date parsing enhancement for "DayName Month Day" format
- âœ… Created proper app.js backup (app.js.fixed-date-parsing)

### Date Parsing Enhancement
The date parsing system has been comprehensively enhanced with a rich contextual approach:

1. **AI Contextual Date Information**
   - New `generateDateTimeContext()` function creates a complete "calendar view" for the AI
   - Provides detailed date context including current week, next week, and reference dates
   - Supplies multiple date formats (ISO, human-readable, etc.) for better AI understanding
   - Enhanced validation logic to prevent incorrect date detection

2. **Pattern-Based Recognition in Fallback System**
   - Support for multiple date formats including "March 15th" and "Thursday March 13th"
   - Enhanced regex patterns for time expressions
   - Improved handling of relative dates ("this Friday", "next Tuesday")

3. **Consistent Timezone Handling**
   - Ensures dates display consistently across all parts of the application
   - Prevents off-by-one errors due to timezone differences
   - Maintains correct date representations regardless of local timezone
   - Properly formats dates in task descriptions with ordinal suffixes

4. **User Confirmation and Control**
   - Added date/time confirmation modal for user verification
   - Provides quick-select options for common dates
   - Allows specific date selection through calendar picker
   - Offers time selection in 15-minute increments
   - Gives users final control over due dates and times

This multi-layered approach significantly improves date handling reliability and ensures consistent date display throughout the application.

## Next Development Priorities

1. âœ… Resolve VS Code conflict to restore app.js to working state
2. âœ… Complete the date parsing enhancement for "Thursday March 13th" format
3. âœ… Implement rich date context in AI prompts to fix overdue task issues
4. âœ… Fix date timezone handling to ensure consistent date display
5. âœ… Implement user date/time confirmation to resolve AI parsing misinterpretations
6. Implement improved code backup procedures
   - Version control integration
   - Automated saving at regular intervals
   - Token limit safeguards
7. Continue planned enhancements to natural language parsing
   - Better context extraction
   - More sophisticated priority detection
8. Enhance error recovery for network issues
9. Add recurring task support to the date/time selection interface
